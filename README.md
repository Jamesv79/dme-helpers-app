# dme-helpers-app
mobile app for volunteer dme foundation micro-donations, I'm creating a nonprofit organization that directly funds vendors who provide Durable Medical Equipment to 
low income individuals who cannot afford either new "DME" or repair already owned "DME" 

The object of the app is to utilize micro-donations in conjuction with grants, local business sponsorships and private donations to support the financial means to help these individuals.
